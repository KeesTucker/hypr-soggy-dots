just use this as a reference, everyone's setup is different, don't copy and paste into ur .config

edit `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to point to your desired wallpaper dir.

run `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to switch wallpaper to a random one and recolour all themes. note; this runs on startup once.
