dis my `.config`. set up for NVIDIA + hyprland.
install hyprland, wallust + all the other shit this `.config` configures. i'll make a list maybe one day.
edit `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to point to your desired wallpaper dir.
run `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to switch wallpaper to a random one and recolour all themes. note; this runs on startup once.
