dis my `.config`. set up for NVIDIA + hyprland.

just use this as a reference, everyone's setup is different, don't copy and paste into ur .config

install hyprland, wallust, jetbrains mono font + all the other shit this `.config` configures. i'll make a list maybe one day.

edit `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to point to your desired wallpaper dir.

run `hypr/custom/wallpaper_randomiser.sh` to switch wallpaper to a random one and recolour all themes. note; this runs on startup once.
