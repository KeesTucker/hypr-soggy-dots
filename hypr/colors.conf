    # rainbowesque pattern for active_border, saturate so that no matter how dull the colour is it'll still pop as the active border
    col.active_border = rgb(791E31) rgb(8A1E35) rgb(AE1C3B)
    # color0 is normally close to the background colour so works nicely here, adding ee as the alpha sets it to 93% transparency
    col.inactive_border = rgba(0F0000ee)
