    # rainbowesque pattern for active_border, saturate so that no matter how dull the colour is it'll still pop as the active border
    col.active_border = rgb(33289E) rgb(9A2949) rgb(25878F)
    # color0 is normally close to the background colour so works nicely here, adding ee as the alpha sets it to 93% transparency
    col.inactive_border = rgba(454345ee)
