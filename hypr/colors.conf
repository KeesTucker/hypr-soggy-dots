    # rainbowesque pattern for active_border, saturate so that no matter how dull the colour is it'll still pop as the active border
    col.active_border = rgb(371EA0) rgb(482BA0) rgb(63339A)
    # color0 is normally close to the background colour so works nicely here, adding ee as the alpha sets it to 93% transparency
